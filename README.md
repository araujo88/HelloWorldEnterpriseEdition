# Hello World Enterprise Edition

Welcome to the **Hello World Enterprise Edition** (HWEE), where we believe even the simplest "Hello, World!" program deserves the full enterprise treatment. This project is designed as a high-complexity solution to a low-complexity problem, demonstrating the wonders of modern software architecture by unnecessarily complicating the classic first program every developer writes.

## Features

- **Singleton Design Pattern**: Ensures that your application consistently says hello in exactly the same way, every time, everywhere.
- **Factory Pattern**: Because why create objects the normal way when you can abstract them behind multiple layers of indirection?
- **Strategy Pattern**: Decouple the logic of saying hello from the act of saying hello, allowing for infinitely customizable greetings.
- **SOLID Principles**: Applied with a heavy hand to ensure that every class is a paragon of virtue in object-oriented design.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

Make sure you have Java installed; any version starting from Java 8 will do, because why require the latest version when you can support legacy systems?

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/araujo88/HelloWorldEnterpriseEdition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd HelloWorldEnterpriseEdition
   ```

3. Compile the Java program:
   ```bash
   javac HelloWorldApp.java
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java HelloWorldApp
   ```

You should see the output `Hello, World!` printed to your console. Congratulations, you've just run the most over-engineered hello world program!
